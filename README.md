This is the firmware to go with my [lightsaber-hardware](https://github.com/proegssilb/lightsaber-hardware) repo.

Current state is firmly "proof of concept". There are many known missing features, but other issues are taking priority at the moment.

If you'd like to help out, file an issue, and I can try to write down some of my thoughts as issues.

Stay tuned. Once some basic hardware is in order, life should get quite a bit more interesting.
